            "Answer:  Run the print head cleaning utility on your printer. If the problem persists, the print heads may need to be aligned. Your printer's maintenance or settings menu should have an option for this.",
            "Question:  Colors are incorrect or washed out.",
                "Answer: Check if the ink or toner cartridges are low or empty. Replace any that are empty and try printing again. You may also need to run a print head alignment or calibration.",
            "Question: The text or images are skewed or crooked",
            "Answer: Perform a print head alignment. This recalibrates the printer's internal components to ensure the lines print straight."

          "Answer: Use the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black) color model for accurate color reproduction on a commercial printer. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is for digital screens.",
          "Question: How do I make sure my document has enough space for an image or text?",
          "Answer: For professional printing, you need to include a 'bleed'. This is an extra 1/8 inch margin around your document to account for any slight variations in the printing and cutting process. This means your finished size should be expanded by 1/4 inch to be safe.",
          "Question: How can I make my printed document larger?",
          "Answer: You can change the paper size in your print settings if your printer supports it (e.g., from Letter to Legal or Tabloid).",
          "Question: What is a good resolution for printing images?",
          "Answer: A resolution of 300 PPI (pixels per inch) is recommended for small print projects like cards and brochures, while 150 PPI is sufficient for larger formats like posters and banners."
